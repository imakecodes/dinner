# Agent Rules

This project enforces high code quality standards.

## Testing
- **Minimum Code Coverage**: The codebase must maintain at least **85%** unit test coverage for lines.
- **Test files**: Co-located in `__tests__` directories mirroring the source structure.
- **Running tests**: Use `pnpm run test:coverage` to verify coverage.

## Future Development
Agents working on this codebase must ensure that any new feature includes comprehensive unit tests to maintain or improve the overall coverage percentage.
